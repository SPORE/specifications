# SPORE - Specification to a POrtable Rest Environment

SPORE is a way to describe public services HTTP APIs such as [twitter] [1]
or applications with an HTTP interface such as [Apache CouchDB] [2]
using a simple language-agnostic JSON document that can be used by
various language-specific implementations to dynamically or statically
generate high level client objects.

The goal of this git repository is to host:

 * the specifications for the [SPORE description language] [3]
 * the specifications for writing a [SPORE client implementation] [4]
